Patterns which a user wants Git to ignore in all situations (e.g., backup or temporary files generated by the user’s editor of choice) generally go into a file specified by core.excludesFile in the user’s ~/.gitconfig. Its default value is /git/ignore. If  is either not set or empty, /root/.config/git/ignore is used instead.
